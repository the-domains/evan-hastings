Theatre is an act of love. I thrive in correctional facilities, community theatres, schools and colleges, devising theatre around urgent issues and inviting dialogue through participatory engagement. Drawing on Theatre of the Oppressed, Drama Therapy and Shadow Theatre, my artistic practice is about healing at the intersection of social justice and aesthetics.
